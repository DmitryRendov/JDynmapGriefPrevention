# JDynmapGriefPrevention

Contributors: jahangir13, DmitryRendov (modified versions); mikeprimm (original version)

### What it is:

A modification of the original [Dynmap-Griefprevention] plugin by mikeprimm with unique features from [jahangir13]. The plugin shows GriefPrevention claim information on the dynmap in different style/colors (admin,user, used,unused claims) based on the absence time of the players and shows relevant info on the claim popups.

### Disclaimer
Since jahangir13 keeps all rights for the modified code I give him all the credentials. This repo is just a fork of his plugin and available for anyone who is familiar with any Java-decompiler. So, this repo is available under another license - MIT. Let me know in case of any issues it makes for you.
