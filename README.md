# JDynmapGriefPrevention

Contributors: mikeprimm (original version); jahangir13, DmitryRendov (modified versions)

### What it is:

A modification of the original [Dynmap-Griefprevention] plugin by mikeprimm with unique features from [jahangir13]. The plugin shows GriefPrevention claim information on the dynmap in different style/colors (admin,user, used,unused claims) based on the absence time of the players and shows relevant info on the claim popups.

### Disclaimer
Mikeprimm and jahangir13 keep all rights reserved for the modified code. I might understand why jahangir13 had not published the source code, it's ugly though it works and I suppose the comunity can significantly improve it with time. This repo is just a fork of [jahangir13]'s de-compiled plugin and available here for anyone under  OSS Apache 2.0 license.
