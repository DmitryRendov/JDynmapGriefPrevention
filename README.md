# JDynmapGriefPrevention

Contributors: jahangir13, DmitryRendov (modified versions); mikeprimm (original version)

### What it is:

A modification of the original [Dynmap-Griefprevention] plugin by mikeprimm with unique features from [jahangir13]. The plugin shows GriefPrevention claim information on the dynmap in different style/colors (admin,user, used,unused claims) based on the absence time of the players and shows relevant info on the claim popups.
